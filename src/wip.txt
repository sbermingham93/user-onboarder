// initial thoughts
// get it working with text inputs first (also will be used if we are having issues with the audio)
// add the audio, so text can be read, and input taken from the mic of the machine
// ui - top - header, 2. what step they are on, 3. input - which is either a text box, or audio input, 4. chat messages

// afterwards we add ai for each step (again may need to fall back to previous solution if issue with AI api)

// tests for hooks, tests for api endpoint, e2e test for text, audio, ai

// make the UI look nicer


// KNOWN BUGS
// first prompt is not being read - not allowed error from the utterance.speak
// simple text parsing can easily miss the keywords
